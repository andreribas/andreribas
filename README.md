## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! Iâ€™m AndrÃ©, a backend developer with over 8 years of experience specializing in PHP. Iâ€™ve spent most of my career building scalable systems, integrating payment methods, and tackling complex challenges in the payments industry. I enjoy working on clean, maintainable code and solving real-world problems through technology.

Youâ€™ll find a mix of personal projects, open-source contributions, and frameworks Iâ€™ve built to make life easier for developers. Iâ€™m passionate about creating tools that improve developer productivity and enjoy experimenting with new tech when time allows.

When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m usually learning something new or sharing knowledge through my blog. Feel free to check out my projects or connect with meâ€”Iâ€™m always up for collaborating!
